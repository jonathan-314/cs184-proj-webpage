<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we implemented spring and collision kinematics for point-masses, spheres, and surfaces to perform simulations on cloth configurations. Our construction of the grid of point-masses first created the list of point-masses then added the structural, shearing, and bending springs in that order. The simulation process involved iterating first through universal forces exerted on all the masses, e.g. gravity, then iterating through all the springs to accumulate spring forces on each point mass. Then to account for collisions, we iterate through the points, and account for external collisions by looking at all external objects, and internal collisions by hashing for nearby points and checking to ensure minimal distancing between them. After all movement had been accounted for, we make adjustments to ensure that each individual spring cannot stretch beyond a certain distance. Our implementation matched that of the paper, which states that between time-steps, springs cannot stretch beyond 10% more than their previous length. Finally, we implemented shading and texture mapping to allow for more sophisticated renderings of the cloth. Not many issues were encountered, but a main one was through iterating over point-masses or springs, making sure to pass by reference as opposed to by value. This ensured that changes made to positions each time-step persisted across the simulation.</p>


<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and Springs</h2>

<p>Shown below are images of the scene 2 wireframe. It is difficult to discern between structural and bending constraints since they are both horizontal or vertical. The top left and bottom right images both show all the constraints, while the top right image shows only shearing constraints which are diagonal and the bottom left image shows only structural and bending constraints which are horizontal and vertical.

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>

<p>Below are images of <em>pinned2</em> with high and low spring constants of <strong>100000 N/m</strong> and <strong>200 N/m</strong> as opposed to the default of <strong>5000 N/m</strong>. A high spring constant will increase internal tension and make the cloth much more rigid and less flexible, and as we can see on the left the cloth is barely allowed to stretch near the top. In contrast, a low spring constant makes the cloth much more flexible and susceptible to gravity, which is why the cloth continues to stretch downwards on the right.</p>

<p>Below are images of <em>pinned2</em> with high and low densities of <strong>500 g/cm^2</strong> and <strong>2 g/cm^2</strong> as opposed to the default of <strong>15 g/cm^2</strong>. Density behaves in an inverse manner to spring constant because the kinematics of the cloth are determined by the spring force in proportion to gravity. Since the spring force is independent of mass, as the mass increases, the spring force becomes less in proportion meaning the kinematics are primarily dominated by gravity, which explains why the cloth stretches in the left image. In contrast, a low density means the spring force becomes greater in proportion meaning the kinematics are primarily dominated by the internal tension of the cloth, which explains its more rigid appearance in the right image.</p>

<p>Below are images of <em>pinned2</em> with high and low damping of <strong>1.00</strong> and <strong>0.00</strong> as opposed to the default of <strong>0.20</strong>. The damping determines what proportion of the kinetic energy is lost as heat, and therefore, high damping means momentum is lost easily and the cloth moves very slowly. As seen in the left image, the cloth is very slow to change, and at the end of the simulation does falls directly into its vertical position and does not recoil. In contrast, low damping means there is almost no loss of energy and momentum domination, and allowing the cloth to fall causes it to oscillate back and forth across the vertical plane, making some nice contortions due to randomness as seen on the right.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part IV: Depth of Field</h2>

<p>Shown below is a progression of how the cloth falls when self-collision is taken into account. As opposed to self-intersecting, it folds neatly over itself in a somewhat zig-zag manner, with deviation due to randomness. It is notable that it takes quite a while in order to stop moving fully. This is because when the point-masses are moving slowly, damping does little to change the amount of energy the system actually has, and friction is not present so the cloth continues to move.</p>

<p>When the density of the cloth is high at <strong>500 g/cm^2</strong>, the cloth more forcibly collapses on itself and makes many more creases since gravity dominates over spring force which ignores the structure of the cloth. In contrast, when the density of the cloth is low at <strong>2 g/cm^2</strong>, the spring force is of significantly greater magnitude and therefore, even after falling the cloth slowly unfolds in order to preserve its original structure. It is also notable that during the fall, the cloth folds much more aggressively at high density, while folding much less at low density.</p>

<p>Similar to the analysis of <em>scene/pinned2</em>, adjusting the spring constant results in inverse effects as to adjusting the density. This is because the kinematics of the system are determined by the proportion of the spring force to the gravitational force, so increasing the spring constant will tend towards maintaining the structure of the system while decreasing the spring constant will tend towards a quicker collapse to the ground. A high spring constant results in less folding, and a minimally-folded final resting state while a low spring constant results in more folding and a forcibly collapsed final resting state.</p>
