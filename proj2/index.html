<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<p>The Casteljau algorithm for Bezier curves recursively computes a linear interpolation of the control points. For each iteration, we iterated through the given control points and computed (1-t)p[i] + tp[i+1], which we then returned. If this function was called recursively until there was one point left, that point would be on the bezier curve. The figures below show how each iteration is computed from the previous iteration, using t = 0.5 (so it takes the midpoint of the previous control points)</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

<p>The Casteljau algorithm for Bezier surfaces simply calls the 1D version multiple times. For the first dimension, 1D Casteljau interpolation is called on each row for parameter <strong>u</strong>. For an <strong>n x n</strong> grid of control points, this produces a vector of <strong>n</strong> intermediate control points. 1D Casteljau interpolation is called again on these intermediate control points with parameter <strong>v</strong> to obtain the final desired point.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<p>To reduce repeated code, we noted that the existing <strong>normal()</strong> function of <strong>Face</strong> already computes a normal vector whose norm is twice the area of the face itself, however, returns the normalized version. Thus, we wrote a function <strong>areaWeightedNormal()</strong> that returns the penultimate result of the code for <strong>normal()</strong>, and modify <strong>normal()</strong> to call that.</p>

<p>Then, to iterate over the faces, we select a starting halfedge then iterate by changing <strong>h</strong> to <strong>h->twin()->next()</strong>. Each iteration, we retrieve the face the halfedge is on, and accumulate the sum of the area weighted normals. This produces a weighted sum of the face normals adjacent to the vertex, and at the end we simply call <strong>unit()</strong> to normalize.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>

<p>To implement Edge Flip, first we gathered all of the faces, vertices, and half edges necessary. Then, we set the neighbors of all 6 half edges, and then set the appropriate pointers of the faces and vertices. Note that we did not create a new half edge; we took the old one and just changed where it pointed from and to. </p>

<p>We ran into an error where we were unable to set the half edge of faces and vertices because it was a protected field, but by playing around with pointers and stuff we were able to get it to work. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>

<p>Carefully. The overall implementation was separated into 5 sections: <ul>
        <li>Getting all vertex, halfedge, and face objects and naming in a way that is easy to understand</li>
        <li>Creating the midpoint, new halfedges, edges, and faces with the same naming convention as before</li>
        <li>Setting pointers for new objects</li>
        <li>Setting pointers for persistent old objects</li>
        <li>Deleting nonpersistent old objects</li>
    </ul> Small things that were almost missed were making sure to update the four original halfedges with new faces, and making sure to correctly delete the original faces. Keeping track of all data structures and variables that needed to be changed allowed us to implement it correctly first try.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>

<p>Level sampling allows us to compute pixel sampling faster and allow for more antialiasing. Instead of going pixel by pixel, level sampling may in some cases jump by many pixels at once (by taking the average which has been precomputed). This allows us to render the images faster. Increasing the number of samples per pixel decreases speed, increases memory usage, and increases antialiasing power since we sample a lot more. Level sampling, on the other hand, is the opposite: as the level number increases, the image becomes blurrier, so it is faster, uses less memory, but also has decreased antialising power. Finally, pixel sampling nearest is slightly faster than bilinear but also is susceptible to aliases. </p>

<div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/Task 6 L0PN.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">Level 0, Nearest Pixel <em>./test6.svg</em>.</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/Task 6 L0PB.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">Level 0, Bilinear Pixel <em>./test6.svg</em>.</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <br>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/Task 6 LBPN.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear Level, Nearest Pixel <em>./test6.svg</em>.</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/Task 6 LBPB.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear Level, Bilinear Pixel <em>./test6.svg</em>.</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>Above show the effects of the various pixel and level sampling methods. As seen above, bilinear pixel causes the image to become more blurred, similar to bilinear levels. However, the bilinear level has a way larger effect than the bilinear pixel. This is because the bilinear pixel is only affected by its neighboring pixels, while the bilinear level could cause each pixel to be affected by pixels dozens of pixels away. </p>
